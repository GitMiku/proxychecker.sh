proxychecker.sh
=============

The script will ask what proxy list file to use; the list file should have one ip per line and be in IP:PORT format.  
Example of a good list file:

    127.0.0.1:4040
    127.0.0.1:8080

After the script finishes two files will be created goodproxies[date].txt and badproxies[date].txt
